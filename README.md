# js13k 2017

## What is this?

A game made for the 2017 [js13k](js13kgames.com) based on [sz-piotr](https://github.com/sz-piotr)s [js13k-webpack-starter](https://github.com/sz-piotr/js13k-webpack-starter)

## What is it about?

Since the 2017 theme of js13k is `lost`, I decided to make a game where you were lost and had to find your way home. It is set in a tile-based cave with limited vision.

... Well it will be. Once it's finished. If it gets finished.
